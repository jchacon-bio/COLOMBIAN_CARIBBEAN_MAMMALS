# COLOMBIAN CARIBBEAN MAMMALS

## Summary

This repository shares an open camera-trap dataset of wild mammals (>1 kg) surveyed across the Colombian Caribbean from 2010 to 2024. It compiles 17,273 records from 635 stations, covering 41 species in nine orders; carnivores and rodents are the most diverse groups, and over one-fifth of the species are threatened. The data support analyses of occupancy, abundance, richness, activity patterns, and interactions in a region with severe habitat loss. The `data/` folder includes two CSV files—`COL_CAR_ MAMMALS_AREA.csv` and `COL_CAR_ MAMMALS_UNIT.csv`—with the sampling information referenced here.
